## 🌈 Overview

**piPodOS** is a stylish, click-wheel-friendly MP3 player originally built for a custom DIY iPod project (hence the 320x240 resolution). While that hardware's still in progress, the app works beautifully on Windows—so I’ve released this version in the meantime!

Built with **Godot 4.4**, piPodOS features a smooth, gradient-based UI and a focus on minimal-yet-powerful controls, file navigation, and media playback.
